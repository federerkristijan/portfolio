  I am ambitious front-end developer looking for a role in
  an IT company, with a healthy work enivronment, that would allow me to dive deeper into coding,
  embrace new creative challenges, and further develop my skills and learn new ones.

  Digital native, cosmopolite and polyglot, with a self-managing 'Can-do' mindset and positive attitude, that would be a rejuvenating addition to your team!
